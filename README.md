### Live Website: [Edgar Caballero (Temporary Domain)](https://edgarcaballerocodes.netlify.app/)

The moment I saw 3D models integrated into websites, I knew my portfolio had to feature them at its core. I began exploring Three.js and later transitioned to React-three-fiber for a more seamless React integration. To optimize performance and load times, I focused on using low-poly models while maintaining a visually engaging experience. 

  ### JavaScript Library: 
      - React JS 
      - ThreeJS 
      - React-three-fiber with React-three-drei

  ### CSS framework: 
      - Tailwind CSS

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
